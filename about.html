<div class="about-content">
  <p>
   Hey I'm Christopher, I'm an aspiring contributor to the bitcoin network! Since
    I was first came across bitcoin I have not stopped learning about it, money and time
   One thing has led to another and now I find myself wanting to learn how to code. Help contribute
   to the money system I believe in with the limited and valuable time I have to offer.
  </p>

  <p> It really all started the second time I came across bitcoin. Truth
    be said I had seen everyone was making money after not holding any the
    first time.  So I got involved again summer of 2017 looking to make a buck,
     then things changed quickly, not only did the price fall, but I fell down
     the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole.</p>
     <p>
     I started to learn about "Money", <b>Do You Know Money?</b></p>
     <p>
     I was reading books, listening to podcasts, watching YouTube content
     changed and it changed everything I though but was really never even taught in school.
      I have been learning about money and what continuosly happens to the money
     systems that were created in the past. We all see where the future is going
     with technology and bitcoin is perhaps undeniably the 1st mathematically
     plausible solution that has been able to challenge the current and age old
      monetary sysytem.</p>
      <p>
      A system that is now so corrupt and damaged that it can really never be
      fixed.
      So I decided to do the most I can to help support and "now" help build the
      future for my children and theirs. I have been providing resources through
      my twitter accout and recent godaddy website I put together. But now I
       can do that with computer code
      and building an idea or just contributing some code to what
      is the best financial tool ever created, that is <b>bitcoin</b>.</p>
      <p>
      Follow me and I will leave behind all the resources I can find to help
       you understand money and see what solutions bitcoin brings that I have learned in my own
       spiral down the rabbit hole.
